## Final Project Proposal

### 1. Abstract

In a few sentences, describe your final project. This abstract will be used as the description in the evaluation survey forms.

This project is a drum machine with a 16-step sequencer and 6 instruments. The sequencer interface resembles that of Roland TR-x0x style drum machines, and the sound is generated by the Yamaha YM3812 FM chip. Additionally, it has a screen for managing settings such as tempo, volume, and tuning.

### 2. Motivation

What is the problem that you are trying to solve? Why is this project interesting? What is the intended purpose?

I (Mia) love music and music technology, as well as the sound of the Yamaha FM synthesizer chips used in PC sound cards of the late 80s and early 90s. While this style of FM is not uncommon as a method for creating melodic sounds, there are very few drum machines using it to generate percussive sounds, rather than other methods such as sample playback or analog circuitry. The goal of this project is to create a drum machine with a familiar interface in the style of the Roland TR-x0x series with the sound of a Yamaha YM3812 FM chip.

### 3. Goals

These are to help guide and direct your progress.

By the end of the project we would like to have a 16-step drum machine with 6 instrument channels and a screen for displaying settings. We plan to have 6 buttons for selecting the current channel. 16 LEDs aligned with the 16 step buttons will indicate the active steps for the current channel, as well as the current step when the sequencer is running. When no channel is selected, by pressing the button for the most recently selected channel again, the screen should display global settings including, at minimum, the tempo. Otherwise, settings for the selected channel, such as tuning and volume, should be displayed. We plan to use a rotary encoder with push button to navigate the on-screen settings.

### 4. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

Formulate key software requirements here.

#### Overview

Using I2C and SPI, the ATmega328PB shall interface with the OPL2 Audio Board, GPIO expanders, and LCD screen. The software shall keep track of active steps in a sequence, looping over the 16 steps and triggering sounds to be generated by the YM3812 in accordance with the active steps. It shall allow users to modify tempo of the sequencer, the active steps, and tuning and volume of the 6 instruments. At startup, it shall configure sounds on channels 1-6 of the YM3812.

#### Users

The users for this device are musicians who want to create 16-step looping drum tracks.

#### Definitions/Abbreviations

step &mdash; units representing the sixteen 16th notes of a 4/4 measure

active step &mdash; For each of the 6 instrument channels, a step may be active or inactive. If if a step is active for a channel, when the sequencer reaches that step, the sound of that channel will be played.

#### Functionality

SRS 01 &mdash; When no channel is selected, users shall be able to use an on-screen menu to set a tempo in a range of 60-300 BPM.

SRS 02 &mdash; The software shall use a PWM timer with a frequency of $`\lfloor\frac{16000000}{2*128*(tempo * 4 / 60)}\rfloor`$. A pin shall be driven high or low in accordance with this pulse signal.

SRS 03 &mdash; When the sequencer is running, for each step, for each channel for which that step is active, a sound corresponding to the channel shall be played by the YM3812.

SRS 04 &mdash; Users shall be able to start or stop the sequencer at any time. Playback shall always start from the first step whenever the sequencer is started.

SRS 05 &mdash; Users shall be able to change the current instrument channel as well as set the active steps for that channel at any time.

SRS 06 &mdash; Using an on-screen menu, users shall be able to modify the tuning and volume of the current instrument channel.

### 5. Hardware Requirements Specification (HRS)

Formulate key hardware requirements here.

#### Overview

The hardware of the design will consist of a series of buttons with various purposes interfacing with the microcontroller, a screen and the synthesizer.

#### Definitions/Abbreviations

OPL2 - Operator Type L 2, another name for the YM3812

#### Functionality

HRS 01 &mdash; ATmega328PB will be the main microcontroller for this design\
HRS 02 &mdash; An adafruit GPIO expander to expand the amount of available pins/registers we have access to\
HRS 03 &mdash; 16 pushbuttons to represent different notes in a measure\
HRS 04 &mdash; 6 more pushbuttons to represent types of drums\
HRS 05 &mdash; 1.8” 128x160 TFT LCD module to display the tempo, volume and the current drum setting\
HRS 06 &mdash; OPL2 Audio Board using a Yamaha YM3812 sound chip with SPI interfacing for audio synthesizing\
HRS 07 &mdash; A rotary encoder for controlling the screen menus and the volume

### 6. MVP Demo

By the first demo, we aim to have all of our features implemented. This way we can leave the fine tuning and the polishing for the last week. This means all of the software and hardware will be implemented and complete, including but not limited to all buttons, knobs and switches. Any extra features we many have time for may or may not be completely implemented at this time

### 7. Final Demo

For the final demo, we will have our full project. This means that since the first demo we will have the entire casing for our design completed (will be 3d printed). The project will be in its full and polished versions. Any extra features that we may have time for will also be implemented during this time and at this point.

### 8. Methodology

What is your approach to the problem?

First we plan to focus on connecting the buttons, LEDs, and screen, and making sure we understand using I2C to communicate with the GPIO expanders. Then we will divide up tasks for writing the sequencer firmware and a library for communicating with the OPL2 Audio Board. The interface for the YM3812 library will consist of a function that take in a pitch and a channel and trigger the sound that has been configured on the given channel at the given pitch, as well as a function that sets the volume of a channel. Additional functions to modify the sounds will be added if there is time.

### 9. Components

What major components do you need and why?

#### ATmega328PB

We plan to use an ATmega328PB as the brains of our device as we have the most familiarity with it, and its specifications match our requirements: 2 SPI buses, I2C bus, and 16 bit timers.

#### Adafruit 358 Screen

We need the current tempo to be displayed, and would like to potentially display other information. We plan to use this screen as we already have it.

#### OPL2 Audio Board

A drum machine requires some method of producing audio. The YM3812 was a widely used chip in PC sound cards and Yamaha keyboards, so it's use for generating musical sounds is well established. It provides 9 instrument channels that can be used simultaneously, fitting our goal of having at least 6. This board provides a serial interface for the chip, as well as incorporating the necessary DAC and timing circuitry required to use it.

#### 16 Step Switch (Adafruit 5499)

Most step sequencers use a row of 16 buttons and LEDs, with the LEDs used to indicate the active steps. Adafruit's step switches conveniently contain both a push button and an led in one casing, providing both components as well as being aesthetically pleasing.

#### GPIO Expander

This project will require many buttons (~25) and LEDs (16). The ATmega does not have enough pins to directly connect each of these, or to wire them in a matrix, so by using a pair of I2C addressable GPIO expanders, we will be able to have enough pins to wire all our peripherals to the MCU.

### 10. Evaluation

What is your metric for evaluating how well your product/solution solves the problem? Think critically on this section. Having a boolean metric such as “it works” is not very useful. This is akin to making a speaker and if it emits sound, albeit however terrible and ear wrenching, declare this a success.
It is recommended that your project be something that you can take pride in. Oftentimes in interviews, you will be asked to talk about projects you have worked on.

Our metric will be made up of the 2 halves below:

#### Sequencer

For the sequencer aspect of this project, the interface (buttons, LEDs, and on-screen menus) should be responsive, with no noticeable delay between input and updating the displays. The tempo should be adjustable in a range of ~60-300 bpm. The tempo should not be inaccurate, and the adjustment should not be too coarse (increments of >4). When it comes to programming the steps and starting and stopping the sequencer, either it works or it doesn't.

#### Drum Sounds/YM3812 Interfacing

The minimum for this part to be considered working at all is for some type of sound to be outputted in accordance with the sequenced step pattern. To meet our goals, each of the sounds should be tunable and have adjustable volume. More subjectively, the sounds should be pleasing and resemble actual drums (bass, snare, hi-hat, etc.).
