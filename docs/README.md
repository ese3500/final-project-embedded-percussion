## Progress Photos

## Results

Our final design was what we had envisioned from the start. It is a laser-cut acrylic enclosure containing the electronics, with 23 buttons, a rotary encoder, a screen, sync jack, and the OPL2 accessible from the top panel. 16 of the buttons have integrated LEDs to display information about the drum pattern and playback, while the other 7 are unlit. It allows for the creation and playback of 6 channel, 16-step drum sequences, with the ability to modify 4 per channel settings, as well as global tempo control.

## Specifications Results

### SRS

<span style="color:lightgreen">SRS 01</span> &mdash; When no channel is selected, users shall be able to use an on-screen menu to set a tempo in a range of 60-300 BPM.

<span style="color:lightgreen">SRS 02</span> &mdash; The software shall use a PWM timer with a frequency of `floor(8000000 / (2 * 64 * (tempo * 4 / 60)))`. A pin shall be driven high or low in accordance with this pulse signal.

<span style="color:lightgreen">SRS 03</span> &mdash; When the sequencer is running, for each step, for each channel for which that step is active, a sound corresponding to the channel shall be played by the YM3812.

<span style="color:lightgreen">SRS 04</span> &mdash; Users shall be able to start or stop the sequencer at any time. Playback shall always start from the first step whenever the sequencer is started.

<span style="color:lightgreen">SRS 05</span> &mdash; Users shall be able to change the current instrument channel as well as set the active steps for that channel at any time.

<span style="color:lightgreen">SRS 06</span> &mdash; Using an on-screen menu, users shall be able to modify the tuning and volume of the current instrument channel.

Our final design meets all software requirements. Our requirements changed slightly over time due to the timing needs of the serial interfaces and the sequencer. SRS02 was updated accordingly. Additionally, we made it possible to modify tempo at all times, rather than only when no instrument channel is selected (it is also not possible to not have one selected), slightly differing from SRS01.

Testing the majority of the requirements were tested just by using the device, as whether or not they are met is easily perceived without measurement tools.

The frequency of the signal on the sync port was measured using an oscilloscope to test SRS02.

### HRS

<span style="color:lightgreen">HRS 01</span> &mdash; ATmega328PB will be the main microcontroller for this design

<span style="color:lightgreen">HRS 02</span> &mdash; An adafruit GPIO expander to expand the amount of available pins/registers we have access to

<span style="color:lightgreen">HRS 03</span> &mdash; 16 pushbuttons to represent different notes in a measure

<span style="color:lightgreen">HRS 04</span> &mdash; 6 more pushbuttons to represent types of drums

<span style="color:lightgreen">HRS 05</span> &mdash; 1.8‚Äù 128x160 TFT LCD module to display the tempo, volume and the current drum setting

<span style="color:lightgreen">HRS 06</span> &mdash; OPL2 Audio Board using a Yamaha YM3812 sound chip with SPI interfacing for audio synthesizing

<span style="color:lightgreen">HRS 07</span> &mdash; A rotary encoder for controlling the screen menus and the volume

Our final design meets all hardware requirements. No changes were made to our hardware requirements over the course of the project.
